= polymer-javaee-mvc-todo


Sample application showing how to use https://polymer-project.org[Polymer^] with https://ozark.java.net/[Java EE MVC 1.0^] and https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/[JAX-RS^].

Presented at JavaOne 2015 by Kito D. Mann, http://www.virtua.com[Virtua, Inc.^]

This app has been tested only with Ozark 1.0.0-m03-SNAPSHOT (specified in `gradle.properties`) and http://bit.ly/1S0EEMI[Payara 4.1.1.154^]. (Payara fixes a https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-21141[Glassfish bug^] which is required to run some of the JAX-RS code.)

NOTE: The ``build.gradle`` file includes the dependencies, but hasn't yet been tested for creating a full WAR (IntelliJ was used for the initial build).
